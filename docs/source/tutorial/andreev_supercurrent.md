# Supercurrent through a quantum dot

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to use Pymablock to compute complicated analytical expressions.
Directly running Pymablock on a large symbolic Hamiltonian can be computationally expensive, and simplifying the inputs and outputs is crucial to obtaining interpretable results in a reasonable amount of time.
Both of these steps benefit from physical insight and advanced manipulation of symbolic expressions.

As an example, we compute supercurrent between two superconductors weakly coupled through a quantum dot.

![Two superconductors and a quantum dot](superconductors_quantum_dot.svg)

We will compute the supercurrent by treating the tunneling to the quantum dot as a perturbation.
This requires calculating and manipulating fourth-order corrections to the ground state energy [^1^].

[^1^]: [Glazman et al.](http://jetpletters.ru/ps/1121/article_16988.pdf)

## Define the Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian of the system is given by

$$
H = H_{\textrm{SC}}+ H_{\textrm{dot}} + H_{T},
$$

where the Hamiltonians of the superconductors, of the quantum dot, and of the tunnel coupling are

$$
H_{\textrm{SC}} =  \sum_{\alpha=L, R} \xi_{\alpha} \left(
    n_{\alpha \uparrow} + n_{\alpha \downarrow} \right)
+ \Gamma_{\alpha} \left( c_{\alpha, \uparrow}^\dagger c_{\alpha \downarrow}^\dagger + c_{\alpha \downarrow} c_{\alpha, \uparrow} \right), \\
H_{\textrm{dot}} = \frac{U}{2} \left( n_{\uparrow} + n_{\downarrow} - N \right)^2. \\
H_{T} = \sum_{\alpha=L,R} t_\alpha \left( c_{\alpha \uparrow}^\dagger d_{\uparrow} + c_{\alpha \downarrow}^\dagger d_{\downarrow} \right) + \textrm{h.c.}.
$$

Here $c_{\alpha, \sigma}$ and $d_{\sigma}$ are the annihilation operators of electrons in the left (L) and right (R) superconductors and quantum dot, respectively, with $\sigma = \uparrow, \downarrow$.
The superconductors' onsite energies are $\xi_{\alpha}$, and their pairing amplitudes are $\Gamma_{\alpha}$.
The quantum dot's charging energy is $U$ and its offset number of electrons, $N$.
The couplings between the quantum dot and the superconductors are $t_{L} = \lvert t_{L} \rvert e^{i \phi}$ and $t_{R} = \lvert t_{R} \rvert$, where $\phi$ is the phase difference between the superconductors.
We treat both of them as independent perturbations.

We start by importing the necessary libraries and defining the symbols and operators in the Hamiltonian.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from IPython.display import display
import numpy as np
import sympy
from sympy import exp, I, symbols, Symbol, Eq
from sympy.physics.quantum.fermion import FermionOp
from sympy.physics.quantum import Dagger

from pymablock import block_diagonalize

# Define symbols
U, N = symbols(r"U N", positive=True)
xis = xi_L, xi_R = symbols(r"\xi_L \xi_R", positive=True)
Gammas = Gamma_L, Gamma_R = symbols(r"\Gamma_L \Gamma_R", positive=True)
ts = t_L_complex, t_R = Symbol("t_Lc", real=False), Symbol("t_R", real=True)

# Dot operators
c_up, c_down = FermionOp(r'c_{d, \uparrow}'), FermionOp(r'c_{d, \downarrow}')

# Superconductor operators
d_ups = FermionOp(r'd_{L, \uparrow}'), FermionOp(r'd_{R, \uparrow}')
d_downs = FermionOp(r'd_{L, \downarrow}'), FermionOp(r'd_{R, \downarrow}')

# Only used for printing. Because sympy forces lexicographic ordering,
# we prepend {} for h.c. to appear last.
hc = sympy.Symbol(r"{}\textrm{h.c.}")

def n(op):
    """Shorthand for Dagger(op) * op"""
    return Dagger(op) * op

def display_eq(title, expr):
    """Print a sympy expression as an equality."""
    display(Eq(sympy.Symbol(title), expr))
```

Here we use `t_L_complex` to avoid complications with simplification routines in
`sympy`, so that $\exp i \phi$ is not expanded into a sine and cosine.

Next, we define the Hamiltonians of quantum dot and tunneling.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Quantum Dot Hamiltonian
H_dot = U * (n(c_up) + n(c_down) - N)**2 / 2

# Tunneling Hamiltonian
H_T = sum(t * (Dagger(c_up) * d_up + Dagger(c_down) * d_down)
    for t, d_up, d_down in zip(ts, d_ups, d_downs)
)  # + h.c. added later
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

display_eq("H_{dot}", H_dot)
display_eq("H_{T}", H_T + hc)
```

### Apply the Bogoliubov transformation

While $H_{\textrm{dot}}$ is already diagonal, the superconductors' Hamiltonian $H_{SC}$ is not.
Therefore, we apply the Bogoliubov transformation on $H_{SC}$, such that the entire unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0 = H_{SC} + H_{\textrm{dot}}$ is diagonal.

:::{admonition} Avoid symbolic diagonalization
:class: dropdown tip

Diagonalizing a large symbolic Hamiltonian is computationally expensive, and in many cases impossible.
To alleviate this, we use physical insight: with the Bogoliubov transformation we get a diagonal unperturbed Hamiltonian.
:::

We define the superconductors' Hamiltonian using the Bogoliubov quasi-particle operators $f_{\alpha, \sigma}$, which are related to the original operators $c_{\alpha, \sigma}$ by the [Bogoliubov transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogoliubov_transformation):

$$
f_{\alpha, \uparrow} = u_\alpha c_{\alpha, \uparrow} + v_\alpha c_{\alpha, \downarrow} \\
f_{\alpha, \downarrow} = u_\alpha c_{\alpha, \downarrow} - v_\alpha c_{\alpha, \uparrow}
$$

where $u_\alpha$ and $v_\alpha$ are complex coefficients that satisfy $u_\alpha^2 + v_\alpha^2 = 1$.
As a result,

$$
H_{SC} = \sum_{\alpha=L, R} \xi_{\alpha} - E_{\alpha} + E_{\alpha} \left(
f_{\alpha, \uparrow}^\dagger f_{\alpha, \uparrow} + f_{\alpha,
\downarrow}^\dagger f_{\alpha, \downarrow} \right),
$$

where $E_{\alpha} = \sqrt{\Gamma_{\alpha}^2 + \xi_{\alpha}^2}$ are the Andreev bound state energies, and $\lvert u_{\alpha} \rvert = \sqrt{\frac{E_{\alpha} + \xi_{\alpha}}{2 E_{\alpha}}}$ and $\lvert v_{\alpha} \rvert = \sqrt{\frac{E_{\alpha} - \xi_{\alpha}}{2 E_{\alpha}}}$ are the Bogoliubov coefficients.

:::{admonition} Avoid square roots
:class: dropdown tip

Using square roots can lead to complicated expressions, because assumptions about the arguments of square roots are not automatically inferred by sympy.
For example, $\sqrt{a^2}$ is not equivalent to $a$, but rather $\lvert a \rvert$.
To avoid lengthy expressions from unsimplified expressions with square roots, we replace them with $E_{\alpha}$, $u_{\alpha}$, and $v_{\alpha}$.
These will appear in the effective Hamiltonian, and we will substitute their values at the end of the calculation.
:::

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Superconductors' energies
Es = E_L, E_R = symbols(r"E_L E_R", positive=True)

# Bogoliubov quasiparticle operators
f_ups = FermionOp('f_{L, \\uparrow}'), FermionOp('f_{R, \\uparrow}')
f_downs = FermionOp('f_{L, \\downarrow}'), FermionOp('f_{R, \\downarrow}')

# Superconductors' Hamiltonian
H_sc = sum(
    xi - E + E * n(f_up) + E * n(f_down)
    for xi, E, f_up, f_down in zip(xis, Es, f_ups, f_downs)
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

display_eq("H_{SC}", H_sc)
```

Similarly, because the tunneling Hamiltonian depends on $d_{\sigma}$, we apply the Bogoliubov transformation to $H_T$ as well.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Bogoliubov coefficients
us = u_L, u_R = symbols(r"u_L u_R", real=True)
vs = v_L, v_R = symbols(r"v_L v_R", real=True)

# Bogoliubov transformation from d operators to f operators
d_subs = {}
for u, v, d_down, d_up, f_down, f_up in zip(us, vs, d_downs, d_ups, f_downs, f_ups):
    d_subs[d_up] = u * f_up - v * Dagger(f_down)
    d_subs[d_down] = u * f_down + v * Dagger(f_up)
    d_subs[Dagger(d_up)] = Dagger(d_subs[d_up])
    d_subs[Dagger(d_down)] = Dagger(d_subs[d_down])

# Substitute d operators with f operators
H_T = H_T.subs(d_subs).expand()  # + h.c., expand to open up parentheses

# Total Hamiltonian
H = H_sc + H_dot + H_T + Dagger(H_T)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

display_eq("H_{T}", H_T + hc)
```

In this basis, the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H$ is diagonal.

### Convert the Hamiltonian to a matrix

Pymablock does not yet support working directly with operators. In the [Jaynesâ€“Cummings tutorial](jaynes_cummings.md) we implemented a custom `solve_sylvester` function. Here the simplest option is to convert the Hamiltonian to a matrix representation.
The following code cell defines a function `to_matrix(...)` that computes the matrix representation of a Hamiltonian `H` with fermionic operators and the corresponding `basis`.
The details of the implementation are hidden for brevity.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

from itertools import combinations

def to_matrix(H):
    """Compute a matrix representation of a sympy expression with fermion operators."""
    # Add an identity operator to all symbols so that we always work with operators
    H = H.subs({
        s: sympy.physics.quantum.IdentityOperator() * s for s in H.free_symbols
        if not isinstance(s, sympy.physics.quantum.Operator)
    })
    # Choose an order of fermionic operators
    fermions = [
        s for s in H.free_symbols
        if (
            isinstance(s, sympy.physics.quantum.fermion.FermionOp)
            and s.is_annihilation
        )
    ]
    fermions.sort(key=lambda f: f.name.name) # Sort by label to ensure consistent order
    # Compute matrix representations
    s_minus = sympy.Matrix([[0, 1], [0, 0]])
    s_z = sympy.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])
    s_0 = sympy.eye(2)
    matrix_subs = {
        op: sympy.kronecker_product(*(i * [s_z] + [s_minus] + (len(fermions) - i - 1) * [s_0]))
        for i, op in enumerate(fermions)
    }
    matrix_subs.update({Dagger(op): Dagger(mat) for op, mat in matrix_subs.items()})
    matrix_subs[sympy.physics.quantum.IdentityOperator()] = sympy.eye(2**len(fermions))

    # Generate basis
    basis = [(sympy.S.One,)]
    for n in range(len(fermions)):
        basis.extend(list(combinations(fermions, n + 1)))
    reversed_basis = list(reversed(basis))
    reversed_basis[-1] = (sympy.S.Zero,)

    basis_matrices = []
    for b, nb in zip(basis, reversed_basis):
        expr = [Dagger(op) * op for op in b]
        expr.extend([sympy.physics.quantum.IdentityOperator()-Dagger(op) * op for op in nb])
        basis_matrices.append(sympy.Mul(*expr).expand())
    basis_matrices = [b.subs(matrix_subs, simultaneous=True).expand() for b in basis_matrices]
    basis_order = [np.nonzero(np.array(b.diagonal(), dtype=int)[0])[0][0] for b in basis_matrices]
    basis = [sympy.Mul(*basis[i]) for i in np.argsort(basis_order)]
    return H.subs(matrix_subs, simultaneous=True).expand(), basis
```

Next, we obtain the matrix Hamiltonian and its basis.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
# Compute Hamiltonian in matrix form
H, basis = to_matrix(H)
```

At this point, we are ready to feed the $64 \times 64$ symbolic Hamiltonian to the block-diagonalization routine of Pymablock.
However, we anticipate two facts:

- The diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian will appear in the denominators in the effective Hamiltonian.
These elements correspond to the dot energies $E_n = U (N - n)^2 / 2$ and the energies of the superconductors $E_{\alpha}$.
- The Hamiltonian separates into two blocks corresponding to even and odd fermion parities.

To make the denominators simpler, we replace the dot energies with $E_n$ right away.

```{code-cell} ipython3
t_L, phi, dphi = symbols(r"t_L \phi \delta\phi", positive=True)
H = H.subs({t_L_complex: t_L * exp(I * (phi + dphi))})

E_0, E_1, E_2 = symbols(r"E_0 E_1 E_2", positive=True)
E_0_value, E_1_value, E_2_value = [(U * (N - i)**2 / 2).expand() for i in range(3)]
H = H.subs({E_2_value: E_2}).subs({E_1_value: E_1}).subs({E_0_value: E_0})
```

Finally, the Hamiltonian is ready for further analysis.

### Identify the ground states

Before computing the effective Hamiltonian, we need to identify the ground states of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$.
Numerically, we observe that the ground states depend on the number of electrons $N$ in the quantum dot.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Values for the parameters
values = {
    U: 10,
    Gamma_L: 0.01,
    Gamma_R: 0.01,
    t_L: 0.4,
    t_R: 0.1,
    xi_L: 0.2,
    xi_R: 0.1,
    E_0: E_0_value,
    E_1: E_1_value,
    E_2: E_2_value,
    phi: np.pi/4,
    dphi: 0,
}

# Extract eigenvalues of the unperturbed Hamiltonian
num = 180
N_values = np.linspace(-0.5, 2.5, num)
eigenvalues = []
for N_value in N_values:
    values.update({
        N: N_value,
        E_L: np.sqrt(values[Gamma_L]**2 + values[xi_L]**2),
        E_R: np.sqrt(values[Gamma_R]**2 + values[xi_R]**2)
    })
    eigenvalues.append(np.array(H.diagonal().subs(values), dtype=complex)[0])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))
ax.plot(N_values, np.array(eigenvalues).real, '-', alpha=0.5);
ax.set_ylim(-0.5, 2.5)
ax.set_xticks([0, 1, 2])
ax.set_xticklabels([r'$0$', r'$1$', r'$2$'])
ax.set_yticks([0, 2])
ax.set_yticklabels([r'$0$', r'$2$'])
ax.set_ylabel('$E$')
ax.set_xlabel(r'$N$')
ax.set_title(r'$H_0$ band structure')
ax.spines["right"].set_visible(False)
ax.spines["top"].set_visible(False)
```

Therefore, we compute the supercurrent for the three regimes separately by considering the ground states for $N=0, 1, 2$ off-set charges in the quantum dot.

## Compute the supercurrent perturbatively

To compute the supercurrent,

$$
I = \frac{e}{\hbar} \frac{dE}{d\phi},
$$

we need to find the perturbed ground state energy $E(\phi)$.
To do so, we finally use Pymablock to compute the perturbative corrections to the ground state Hamiltonian.
To take advantage of the block-diagonal structure of the Hamiltonian, we define separate subspaces for even and odd parity sectors.
Additionally, because we are interested in different ground states, we define a separate subspace for $N=0, 1, 2$.
The block-diagonalization routine for the five subspaces is called using:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

ground_states = [sympy.S.One, c_up, c_down, c_up * c_down]  # vacuum state
subspaces = {
    sympy.S.One: 0,  # N=0
    c_up: 1,  # N=1
    c_down: 1,  # N=1
    c_down * c_up: 2,  # N=2
}
subspace_indices = [
    subspaces.get(element, 3 if len(element.free_symbols) % 2 else 4) for element in basis
]
H_tilde = block_diagonalize(H, subspace_indices=subspace_indices, symbols=[t_L, t_R, dphi])[0]
```

`subspace_indices` is a list with `0` for every basis state that we include in the $N=0$ subspace, `1` for the $N=1$ subspace, `2` for the $N=2$ subspace, `3` for the even parity remaining states, and `4` for the odd parity remaining states.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]
subspace_indices
```

Because we plan to take a derivative with respect to $\phi$ of the result, we treated $\delta\phi$ as a small parameter that we only compute to the first order and set $\delta\phi = 1$.
This saves resources by avoiding a computation of the derivative and complicated expressions.

We start by finding the corrections to the ground state for $N=0$, which is the vacuum state $\lvert 0\rangle$.
The first nonzero correction to the ground state energy appears in the order $\mathcal{O}(t_L^2 t_R^2)$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
current = sympy.trace(H_tilde[0, 0, 2, 2, 1]).doit().subs({dphi: 1})
```

Here we computed the trace of `H_22` as a way to obtain the sum of the eigenvalues.
This is a $1 \times 1$ matrix, and the trace is the only element of this matrix, but we use the `sympy.Trace` function to make the code generalizable to larger matrices.
The result, however, is complicated and requires simplification.

### Simplify the expression

To simplify the supercurrent expression, we first identify common patterns:

+ The expression is formed by a sum of fractions.
+ Terms share common prefactors, which are good to factor out.
+ The numerators contain products of $u_{\alpha} v_{\alpha}$, $u_{\alpha}^2$, and $v_{\alpha}^2$, all of which are free of square roots.

```{code-cell} ipython3
display(Eq(Symbol('I(n=0)'), current))
```

:::{admonition} Do not call `simplify()` on large expressions
:class: dropdown

Sympy provides several simplification routines, such as `simplify()`, `expand()`, `factor()`, and `collect()`, among [others](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/simplification.html).
The most general simplification routine is `simplify()`, which tries a combination of simplification routines to the expression.
However, this routine can be unnecessarily slow and it is not guaranteed to simplify the expression to the desired form.
Therefore, we analyze instead the expression and identify common patterns to simplify it manually.
:::

Therefore, we simplify the expression by factoring out the prefactor, replacing the products of $u_{\alpha}$ and $v_{\alpha}$ with their expressions, and grouping the fractions by their denominators to then simplify the numerators.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Define Bogoliubov substitutions
subs = (
    {u * v: Gamma / (2 * E) for u, v, Gamma, E in zip(us, vs, Gammas, Es)}
    | {u**2: (1 + xi / E) / 2 for u, xi, E in zip(us, xis, Es)}
    | {v**2: (1 - xi / E) / 2 for v, xi, E in zip(vs, xis, Es)}
)

def simplify_current(expr):
    """Simplification routine tailored to the perturbative calculation of current."""
    return sympy.re(expr.factor()).simplify().subs(subs)
```

We see that this simplification produces a compact result.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
current = simplify_current(current)

display_eq('I(n=0)', current)
```

Applying the same procedure to the other two ground states, we compute the supercurrent for the $n=1$ and $n=2$ ground states.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
currents = [
    simplify_current(sympy.trace(H_tilde[i, i, 2, 2, 1]).subs({dphi: 1}).doit())
    for i in range(3)
]
for i, current in enumerate(currents):
    display_eq(f"I(n={i + 1})", current)
```

## Visualize the results

Finally, we plot the critical current, $I_{c, N} = \lvert I_N(\phi=\pi/4) \rvert$, as a function of the number of electrons $N$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

N_values = np.linspace(-0.5, 2.5, num)
current_values = [np.array([current.subs({**values, N: N_value}) for N_value in N_values], dtype=float) for current in currents]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))
ax.plot(N_values, np.abs(current_values[0]), '-', label=r'$N=0$')
ax.plot(N_values, np.abs(current_values[1]), '-', label=r'$N=1$')
ax.plot(N_values, np.abs(current_values[2]), '-', label=r'$N=2$')
ax.set_xlabel(r'$N$')
ax.set_ylabel(r'$I_c$')
ax.set_title(r'Critical current')
ax.set_xticks([0, 1, 2])
ax.set_xticklabels([r'$0$', r'$1$', r'$2$'])
ax.legend(frameon=False)
ax.spines["right"].set_visible(False)
ax.spines["top"].set_visible(False)
```
