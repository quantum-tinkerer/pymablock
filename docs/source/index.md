# {{Pymablock}}

## What is {{Pymablock}}?

{{Pymablock}} (Python matrix block-diagonalization) is a Python package that constructs
effective models using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory.
It handles both numerical and symbolic inputs, and it efficiently
block-diagonalizes Hamiltonians with multivariate perturbations to arbitrary
order.

Building an effective model using {{Pymablock}} is a three step process:
* Define a Hamiltonian
* Call {autolink}`~pymablock.block_diagonalize`
* Request the desired order of the effective Hamiltonian

```python
from pymablock import block_diagonalize

# Define perturbation theory
H_tilde, *_ = block_diagonalize([h_0, h_p], subspace_eigenvectors=[vecs_A, vecs_B])

# Request correction to the effective Hamiltonian
H_AA_4 = H_tilde[0, 0, 4]
```

## Why {{Pymablock}}?
Here is why you should use {{Pymablock}}:

* Do not reinvent the wheel

  {{Pymablock}} provides a tested reference implementation

* Apply to any problem

  {{Pymablock}} supports `numpy` arrays, `scipy` sparse arrays, `sympy` matrices and
  quantum operators

* Speed up your code

  Due to several optimizations, {{Pymablock}} can reliably handle both higher orders
  and large Hamiltonians

## How does {{Pymablock}} work?

{{Pymablock}} considers a Hamiltonian as a series of $2\times 2$ block operators
with the zeroth order block-diagonal.
To carry out the block-diagonalization procedure, {{Pymablock}} finds a minimal
unitary transformation $U$ that cancels the off-diagonal block of the
Hamiltonian order by order.

\begin{gather}
H = \begin{pmatrix}H_0^{AA} & 0 \\ 0 & H_0^{BB}\end{pmatrix} + \sum_{i\geq 1} H_i,\quad
U = \sum_{i=0}^\infty U_n
\end{gather}

The result of this procedure is a perturbative series of the transformed
block-diagonal Hamiltonian.

\begin{gather}
\tilde{H} = U^\dagger H U=\sum_{i=0}
\begin{pmatrix}
\tilde{H}_i^{AA} & 0 \\
0 & \tilde{H}_i^{BB}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{gather}

Similar to Lowdin perturbation theory or the Schriefferâ€“Wolff transformation,
{{Pymablock}} solves Sylvester's equation and imposes unitarity at every order.
However, differently from other approaches, {{Pymablock}} uses efficient algorithms
by choosing an appropriate parametrization of the series of the unitary
transformation.
As a consequence, the computational cost of every order scales linearly with
the order, while the algorithms are still mathematically equivalent.

To see {{Pymablock}} in action, check out the [tutorial](tutorial/tutorial.md).
See its [algorithms](algorithms.md) to learn about the underlying ideas, or read
the [reference documentation](documentation/pymablock.rst) for the package API.

## What does {{Pymablock}} not do yet?

* {{Pymablock}} is not able to treat time-dependent perturbations yet
* {{Pymablock}} does not block diagonalize more than two subspaces simultaneously

## Installation

The preferred way of installing `pymablock` is to use `mamba`/`conda`:

```
mamba install pymablock -c conda-forge
```

Or use `pip`

```
pip install pymablock
```

```{important}
Be aware that the using `pymablock` on large Hamiltonians requires `Kwant`
with [MUMPS](https://mumps-solver.org/index.php) support.
For this purpose, install Kwant
[via conda](https://kwant-project.org/install#conda) in Linux and MAC OS.
Unfortunately, MUMPS support in Kwant is not available for Windows.
If you need it, try
[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
