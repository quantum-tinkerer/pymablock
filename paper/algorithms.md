# Pymablock algorithms

**Pymablock considers a Hamiltonian as a series of $2 \times 2$ block operators and finds a minimal unitary transformation that separates its subspaces.**

**The result of this procedure is a perturbative series of the transformed block-diagonal Hamiltonian.**

**The transformed Hamiltonian is equivalent to that of other perturbative methods, but the algorithm is efficient.**

**Pymablock finds the unitary transformation recursively, using unitarity and solving Sylvester's equation at every order.**

## Tailored algorithms

**Pymablock has two algorithms, general and expanded, tailored for different use cases.**

## General algorithm

## Expanded algorithm

## Implicit algorithm
