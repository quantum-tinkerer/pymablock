\section{Perturbative block-diagonalization algorithm}

\subsection{Problem statement}

Pymablock finds a series of the unitary transformation $\mathcal{U}$ (we use calligraphic letters to denote series) that block-diagonalizes the Hamiltonian
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hamiltonian}
\mathcal{H} = H_0 + \mathcal{H}',\quad H_0 = \begin{pmatrix}
H_0^{AA} & 0\\
0 & H_0^{BB}
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
%
with $\mathcal{H}' = \mathcal{H}'_{D} + \mathcal{H}'_{O}$ containing an arbitrary number and orders of perturbations with block-diagonal and block-offdiagonal components, respectively.
The series here may be multivariate, and they represent sums of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A} = \sum_{n_1=0}^\infty \sum_{n_2=0}^\infty \cdots \sum_{n_k=0}^\infty \lambda_1^{n_1} \lambda_2^{n_2} \cdots \lambda_k^{n_k} A_{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k},
\end{equation}
%
where $\lambda_i$ are the perturbation parameters and $A_{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k}$ are linear operators.
%
The problem statement, therefore, is finding $\mathcal{U}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ such that
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:problem_definition}
\tilde{\mathcal{H}} = \mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{H} \mathcal{U},\quad \tilde{\mathcal{H}}^{AB} = 0,\quad \mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{U} = 1,
\end{equation}
%
which is schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:block_diagonalization}.
Series multiply according to the Cauchy product:
%
$$
\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{A}\mathcal{B} \Leftrightarrow C_\mathbf{n} = \sum_{\mathbf{m} + \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{n}} A_\mathbf{m} B_\mathbf{p}.
$$
%
The Cauchy product is the most expensive operation in perturbation theory, because it involves a large number of multiplications between potentially large matrices.
For example, evaluating $\mathbf{n}$-th order of $\mathcal{C}$ requires $\sim\prod_i n_i \equiv N$ multiplications of the series elements.\footnote{If both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are known in advance, fast Fourier transform-based algorithms can reduce this cost to $\sim N \log N$. In our problem, however, the series are constructed recursively and therefore this optimization is impossible.}
A direct computation of all the possible index combinations in a product between three series $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{B}\mathcal{C}$ would have a higher cost $\sim N^2$, however, if we use associativity of the product and compute this as $(\mathcal{A}\mathcal{B})\mathcal{C}$, then the scaling of the cost stays $\sim N$.

There are many ways to solve the problem~\eqref{eq:problem_definition} that give identical expressions for $\mathcal{U}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$.
We are searching for a procedure that satisfies two additional constraints:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item It has the same complexity scaling as a Cauchy product, and therefore
    $\sim N$ multiplications per additional order.
    \item It does not require multiplications by $H_0$.
    \item It requires only one Cauchy product by $\mathcal{H}_D$, the block-diagonal
    part of $\mathcal{H}$.
\end{itemize}
%
The first requirement is that of the optimal scaling: because the desired expression is at least a Cauchy product of $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{H}$, the complexity scaling of the algorithm may not be lower than the complexity of a Cauchy product.
The second requirement is because in perturbation theory, $n$-th order corrections to $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ carry $n$ energy denominators $1/(E_i - E_j)$, where $E_i$ and $E_j$ are the eigenvalues of $H_0$ belonging to different subspaces.
Therefore, any additional multiplications by $H_0$ must cancel with additional energy denominators.
Multiplying by $H_0$ is therefore unnecessary work, and it gives longer intermediate expressions.
The third requirement we impose by by considering a case in which $\mathcal{H}_{O}=0$, where $\mathcal{H}_D$ must at least enter $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ as an added term, without any products.
Moreover, because $\mathcal{U}$ depends on the entire Hamiltonian, there must be at least one Cauchy product by $\mathcal{H}'_D$.
The goal of our algorithm is thus to be efficient and to produce compact results that do not require further simplifications.

\subsection{Existing solutions}
\co{Pymablock's algorithm does not use the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation, because the former is inefficient.}
A common approach to constructing effective Hamiltonians is to use the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation~\cite{Schrieffer_1966}:
%
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathcal{H}} = e^\mathcal{S} \mathcal{H} e^{-\mathcal{S}}, \\
e^{\mathcal{S}} = 1 + \mathcal{S} + \frac{1}{2!} \mathcal{S} \mathcal{S}
+ \frac{1}{3!} \mathcal{S} \mathcal{S} \mathcal{S} + \cdots,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathcal{S} = \sum_n S_n$ is an antihermitian polynomial series in the perturbative parameter, making $e^\mathcal{S}$ a unitary transformation.
Requiring that $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}^{AB} = 0$ gives a recursive equation for $S_n$, whose terms are nested commutators between the series of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{H}$.
Similarly, the transformed Hamiltonian is given by a series of nested commutators
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SW_H}
\tilde{\mathcal{H}} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{1}{j!} \Big [\mathcal{H}, \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} S_n \Big ]^{(j)},
\end{equation}
%
where the superscript $(j)$ denotes the $j$-th nested commutator $[A, B]^{(j)} = [[A, B]^{(j-1)}, B]$, with $[A, B]^{(0)} = A$ and $[A, B]^{(1)} = AB - BA$.
Regardless of the specific implementation, this expression does not meet either of our two requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The direct computation of the series elements requires $\sim \exp N$ multiplications, and even an optimized one has a $\sim N^2$ scaling.
  \item Evaluating Eq.~\eqref{eq:SW_H} contains multiplications by $H_0$.
\end{itemize}

\co{There are algorithms that use different parametrizations for U a difference that is crucial for efficiency, even though the results are equivalent.}
Alternative parametrizations of the unitary transformation $\mathcal{U}$ require solving unitarity and block diagonalization conditions too, but give rise to a different recursive procedure for the series elements.
For example, using hyperbolic functions
%
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{U} = \cosh{\mathcal{G}} + \sinh{\mathcal{G}}, \quad
\mathcal{G} = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} G_i,
\end{gather}
%
leads to different recursive expressions for $G_i$ \cite{Shavitt_1980}, but does not change the algorithm's complexity.
On the other hand, using a polynomial series directly
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U} = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} U_i,
\end{equation}
%
gives rise to another recursive equation for $U_i$ \cite{Van_Vleck_1929, Lowdin_1962, Klein_1974, Suzuki_1983}.
Still, this choice results in an expression for $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ whose terms include products by $H_0$, and therefore requires additional simplifications.

\co{The existing algorithms with linear scaling are not suitable for the construction of an effective Hamiltonian.}
The following three algorithms satisfy both of our requirements while solving a related problem.
First, density matrix perturbation theory~\cite{McWeeny_1962,McWeeny_1968,Truflandier_2020} constructs the density
matrix $\mathcal{\rho}$ of a perturbed system as a power series with respect to a perturbative parameter:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{\rho} = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \rho_i.
\end{equation}
%
The elements of the series are found by solving two recursive conditions, $\mathcal{\rho}^2 = \mathcal{\rho}$ and $[\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{\rho}]=0$, which avoid multiplications by $H_0$ and require a single Cauchy product each.
This approach, however, deals with the entire Hilbert space, rather than the low-energy subspace, and does not provide an effective Hamiltonian.
Second, the perturbative similarity transform by C.~Bloch~\cite{Bloch_1958,Bravyi_2011} constructs the effective Hamiltonian in a non-orthogonal basis, which preserves the Hamiltonian spectrum while breaking its hermiticity.
Finally, the recursive Schrieffer--Wolff algorithm~\cite{Li_2022} applies the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation to the output of lower-order iterations, and calculates the effective Hamiltonian at a fixed perturbation strength, rather
than as a series.
We thus identify the following open question: can we construct an effective Hamiltonian with a linear scaling algorithm that produces compact expressions?

\subsection{Pymablock's algorithm}
\label{sec:pymablock_algorithm}

\co{We use recursive expressions, for example, to apply the unitarity condition.}
The first idea that Pymablock exploits is the recursive evaluation of the operator series, which we illustrate by considering the unitarity condition.
Let us separate the transformation $\mathcal{U}$ into an identity and $\mathcal{U}' = \mathcal{W} + \mathcal{V}$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U}
\mathcal{U} = 1 + \mathcal{U}' = 1 + \mathcal{W} + \mathcal{V},\quad \mathcal{W}^\dagger = \mathcal{W},\quad \mathcal{V}^\dagger = -\mathcal{V}.
\end{equation}
%
We use the unitarity condition $\mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{U} = 1$ by substituting $\mathcal{U}'$ into it:
%
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:unitarity}
  1 = (1 + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger)(1+\mathcal{U}') = 1 + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger + \mathcal{U}' + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{U}'.
\end{gather}
%
This immediately yields \begin{gather}
\label{eq:W}
\mathcal{W} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathcal{U}'^\dagger + \mathcal{U}') = -\frac{1}{2} \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{U}'.
\end{gather}
%
Because $\mathcal{U}'$ has no $0$-th order term, $(\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{U}')_\mathbf{n}$ does not depend on the $\mathbf{n}$-th order of $\mathcal{U}'$ nor $\mathcal{W}$.
Alternatively, using Eq.~\eqref{eq:U} we could define $\mathcal{W}$ as a Taylor series in $\mathcal{V}$:
%
$$
\mathcal{W} = \sqrt{1 + \mathcal{V}^2} - 1 \equiv f(\mathcal{V}) \equiv \sum_n a_n \mathcal{V}^{2n}.
$$
%
A direct computation of all possible products of terms in this expression requires $\sim \exp N$ multiplications.
A more efficient approach for evaluating this expression introduces each term in the sum as a new series $\mathcal{A}^{n+1} = \mathcal{A}\mathcal{A}^{n}$ and reuses the previously computed results.
This optimization brings the exponential cost down to $\sim N^2$.
However, we see that the Taylor expansion approach is both more complicated and more computationally expensive than the recurrent definition in Eq.~\eqref{eq:W}.
Therefore, we use Eq.~\eqref{eq:W} to efficiently compute $\mathcal{W}$.
More generally, a Cauchy product $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{B}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ have no $0$-th order terms depends on $\mathcal{A}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{A}_{n-1}$ and $\mathcal{B}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{B}_{n-1}$.
This makes it possible to use $\mathcal{AB}$ in a recurrence relation, a property that we exploit throughout the algorithm.

\co{To fully define the unitary transformation, we make a choice for V.}
To compute $\mathcal{U}'$ we also need to find $\mathcal{V}$, which is defined by the requirement $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}^{AB} = 0$.
Additionally, we constrain $\mathcal{V}$ to be block off-diagonal: $\mathcal{V}^{AA} = \mathcal{V}^{BB} = 0$, a choice we make to ensure that the resulting unitary transformation is equivalent to the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation (see section~\ref{seq:SW_equivalence}).
In turn, this makes $\mathcal{W}$ block-diagonal and makes the norm of $\mathcal{U}'$ minimal.

\co{We find V and the transformed Hamiltonian.}
The remaining condition for finding a recurrent relation for $\mathcal{U}'$ is that the transformed Hamiltonian
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:H_tilde_def}
\tilde{\mathcal{H}} = \mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{H} \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{H}_{D} +
\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{H}_{D} + \mathcal{H}_{D} \mathcal{U}' + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{H}_{D}
\mathcal{U}' + \mathcal{U}^\dagger\mathcal{H}'_{O}\mathcal{U},
\end{equation}
%
is block-diagonal, a condition that determines $\mathcal{V}$.
Here we used $\mathcal{U}=1+\mathcal{U}'$ and $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_{D} + \mathcal{H}'_{O}$, since $H_0$ is block-diagonal by definition.
Because we want to avoid products by $\mathcal{H}_{D}$, we need to get rid of the terms that contain it by replacing them with an alternative expression.
Our strategy is to define an auxiliary operator $\mathcal{X}$ that we can compute without ever multiplying by $\mathcal{H}_{D}$.
Like $\mathcal{U}'$, $\mathcal{X}$ needs to be defined via a recurrence relation, which we determine later.
Because Eq.~\eqref{eq:H_tilde_def} contains $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ multiplied by $\mathcal{U}'$ from the left and from the right, eliminating $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ requires moving it to the same side.
To achieve this, we choose $\mathcal{X}=\mathcal{Y}+\mathcal{Z}$ to be the commutator between $\mathcal{U}'$ and $\mathcal{H}_{D}$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:XYZ}
\mathcal{X} \equiv [\mathcal{U}', \mathcal{H}_{D}] = \mathcal{Y} + \mathcal{Z}, \quad
\mathcal{Y} \equiv [\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{H}_{D}] = \mathcal{Y}^\dagger,\quad
\mathcal{Z} \equiv [\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{H}_{D}] = -\mathcal{Z}^\dagger,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathcal{Y}$ is therefore block off-diagonal and $\mathcal{Z}$, block diagonal.
We use $\mathcal{H}_{D} \mathcal{U}' = \mathcal{U}' \mathcal{H}_{D} -\mathcal{X}$ to move $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ through to the right and find
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:H_tilde}
\begin{aligned}
  \tilde{\mathcal{H}}
  &= \mathcal{H}_{D} + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{H}_{D} + (\mathcal{H}_{D} \mathcal{U}') + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{H}_{D}
  \mathcal{U}' + \mathcal{U}^\dagger(\mathcal{H}'_{O}\mathcal{U})
  \\
  &= \mathcal{H}_{D} + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{H}_{D} + \mathcal{U}'\mathcal{H}_{D} - \mathcal{X} + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger (\mathcal{U}' \mathcal{H}_{D} - \mathcal{X}) + \mathcal{U}^\dagger\mathcal{H}'_{O}\mathcal{U} \\
  &= \mathcal{H}_{D} + (\mathcal{U}'^\dagger + \mathcal{U}' + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{U}')\mathcal{H}_{D} - \mathcal{X} - \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X} + \mathcal{U}^\dagger\mathcal{H}'_{O}\mathcal{U} \\
  &= \mathcal{H}_{D} - \mathcal{X} - \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X} + \mathcal{U}^\dagger\mathcal{H}'_{O}\mathcal{U},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where the terms multiplied by $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ cancel according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:unitarity}.
The transformed Hamiltonian does not contain multiplications by $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ anymore, but it does depend on $\mathcal{X}$, an auxiliary operator whose recurrent definition we do not know yet.
To find it, we first focus on its anti-Hermitian part, $\mathcal{Z}$.
Since recurrence relations are expressions whose right-hand side contains Cauchy products between series, we need to find a way to make a product appear.
We do so by using the unitarity condition $\mathcal{U}'^\dagger + \mathcal{U}' = -\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{U}'$ to obtain the recursive definition of $\mathcal{Z}$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Z}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{Z}
&= \frac{1}{2} (\mathcal{X} - \mathcal{X}^{\dagger}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\Big[ (\mathcal{U}' + \mathcal{U}'^{\dagger}) \mathcal{H}_{D} - \mathcal{H}_{D} (\mathcal{U}' + \mathcal{U}'^{\dagger}) \Big] \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \Big[ - \mathcal{U}'^{\dagger} (\mathcal{U}'\mathcal{H}_{D} - \mathcal{H}_{D} \mathcal{U}') + (\mathcal{U}'\mathcal{H}_{D} - \mathcal{H}_{D} \mathcal{U}')^{\dagger} \mathcal{U}' \Big] \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (-\mathcal{U}'^{\dagger} \mathcal{X} + \mathcal{X}^{\dagger} \mathcal{U}').
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
Similar to computing $W_{\mathbf{n}}$, computing $Z_{\mathbf{n}}$ requires lower-orders of $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{U}'$.
Then, we compute the Hermitian part of $\mathcal{X}$ by requiring that $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}^{AB} = 0$ in the Eq.~\eqref{eq:H_tilde} and find
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Y}
\mathcal{X}^{AB} = (\mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{H}'_{O} \mathcal{U} -
\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X})^{AB}.
\end{equation}
%
Once again, despite $\mathcal{X}$ enters the right hand side, because all the terms lack \nth{0} order, this defines a recursive relation for $\mathcal{X}^{AB}$, and therefore $\mathcal{Y}$.

The final part is straightforward: using $\mathcal{H}_{D} = H_0 + \mathcal{H}'_{D}$ and the definition of $\mathcal{Y}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:XYZ} fixes $\mathcal{V}$ as a solution of:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sylvester}
\mathcal{V}^{AB}H_0^{BB} - H_0^{AA} \mathcal{V}^{AB} = \mathcal{Y}^{AB} - [\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{H}'_{D}]^{AB},
\end{equation}
%
a Sylvester's equation, which we only need to solve once for every new order.
In the eigenbasis of $H_0$, the solution of Sylvester's equation is $V^{AB}_{\mathbf{n}, ij} = (\mathcal{Y} - [\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{H}'_{D}])^{AB}_{\mathbf{n}, ij}/(E_i - E_j)$, where $E_i$ are the eigenvalues of $H_0$.

\co{The algorithm is complete.}
We now have the complete algorithm:
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define series $\mathcal{U}'$ and $\mathcal{X}$ and make use of their block structure and Hermiticity.
    \item To define the diagonal blocks of $\mathcal{U}'$, use $\mathcal{W} = -\mathcal{U}'^\dagger\mathcal{U}'/2$.
    \item To find the off-diagonal blocks of $\mathcal{U}'$, solve Sylvester's equation \\ $\mathcal{V}^{AB}H_0^{BB} - H_0^{AA}\mathcal{V}^{AB} = \mathcal{Y}^{AB} - [\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{H}'_{D}]^{AB}$.
      This requires $\mathcal{X}$.
    \item To find the diagonal blocks of $\mathcal{X}$, define $\mathcal{Z} = (-\mathcal{U}'^\dagger\mathcal{X} + \mathcal{X}^\dagger\mathcal{U}')/2$.
    \item For the off-diagonal blocks of $\mathcal{X}$, use $\mathcal{Y}^{AB} =
    (-\mathcal{U}'^\dagger\mathcal{X} + \mathcal{U}^\dagger\mathcal{H}'\mathcal{U})^{AB}$.
    \item  Compute the effective Hamiltonian as $\tilde{\mathcal{H}} = \mathcal{H}_{D} - \mathcal{X} - \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X} + \mathcal{U}^\dagger\mathcal{H}'_{O}\mathcal{U}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Equivalence to Schrieffer--Wolff transformation}
\label{seq:SW_equivalence}
\co{Our algorithm is equivalent to a Schrieffer--Wolff transformation}
Pymablock's algorithm and the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation find a unitary transformation $\mathcal{U}$ such that $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}^{AB}=0$.
They are therefore equivalent up to a gauge choice in each subspace, $A$ and $B$.
We establish the equivalence between the two by demonstrating that this gauge choice is the same for both algorithms.
The Schrieffer--Wolff transformation uses $\mathcal{U} = \exp \mathcal{S}$, where $\mathcal{S} = -\mathcal{S}^\dagger$ and $\mathcal{S}^{AA} = \mathcal{S}^{BB} = 0$.
The series $\exp\mathcal{S}$ contains all possible products of $S_n$ of all lengths with fractional prefactors.
For every term $S_{k_1}S_{k_2}\cdots S_{k_n}$, there is a corresponding term $S_{k_n}S_{k_{n-1}}\cdots S_{k_1}$ with the same prefactor.
If the number of $S_{k_n}$ is even, then both terms are block-diagonal since each $S_n$ is block off-diagonal.
Because $S_n$ are anti-Hermitian, the two terms are Hermitian conjugates of each other, and therefore their sum is Hermitian.
On the other hand, if the number of $S_{k_n}$ is odd, then the two terms are block off-diagonal and their sum is anti-Hermitian by the same reasoning.
Therefore, just like in our algorithm, the diagonal blocks of $\exp S$ are Hermitian, while off-diagonal blocks are anti-Hermitian.
Finally, because the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation produces a unique answer and satisfies the same diagonalization requirements as our algorithm, the two produce the same effective Hamiltonian.

\subsection{Extra optimization: common subexpression elimination}
While the algorithm of Sec.~\ref{sec:pymablock_algorithm} satisfies our requirements, we optimize it further by reusing products that are needed in several places.
Firstly, we rewrite the expressions for $\mathcal{Z}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Z} and $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:H_tilde} by utilizing the Hermitian conjugate of $\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X}$ without recomputing it:
%
\begin{gather*}
\mathcal{Z} = \frac{1}{2}\left[(-\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X})- \textrm{h.c.}\right],\\
\tilde{\mathcal{H}} = \mathcal{H}_{D} + \mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{H}'_{O} \mathcal{U} - (\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X} + \textrm{h.c.})/2,
\end{gather*}
%
where $\textrm{h.c.}$ is the Hermitian conjugate, and $\mathcal{X}$ drops out from the diagonal blocks of $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ because the diagonal blocks of $\mathcal{X}$ are anti-Hermitian.
%
Additionally, we reuse the repeated $\mathcal{A} \equiv \mathcal{H}'_{O}\mathcal{U}'$ in
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:UHU}
\mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{H}'_{O} \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{H}'_{O} + \mathcal{A} + \mathcal{A}^\dagger + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{A}.
\end{equation}
%
Next, we observe that some products from the $\mathcal{U}^{\dagger} \mathcal{H}_{O}\mathcal{U}$ term appear both in $\mathcal{X}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Y} and in $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$~\eqref{eq:H_tilde}.
%
To avoid recomputing these products, we introduce $\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{X} - \mathcal{H}'_{O} - \mathcal{A}$ and define the recursive algorithm using $\mathcal{B}$ instead of $\mathcal{X}$.
%
With this definition, we compute the off-diagonal blocks of $\mathcal{B}$ as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:B_offdiag}
\begin{aligned}
  \mathcal{B}^{AB, BA} &= \left[\mathcal{X} - \mathcal{H}'_{O} - \mathcal{A} \right]^{AB, BA}\\
  &= \left[\mathcal{A}^\dagger + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger\mathcal{A} - \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X} \right]^{AB, BA}\\
  &= \left[\mathcal{U}'^\dagger\mathcal{H}'_{O} + \mathcal{U}'^\dagger\mathcal{A} - \mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X} \right]^{AB, BA}\\
  &= -(\mathcal{U'}^\dagger \mathcal{B})^{AB, BA},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where we also used Eq.~\eqref{eq:Y} and the definition of $\mathcal{A}$.
The off-diagonal blocks of $\mathcal{B}$, on the other hand, are given by
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:B_diag}
\begin{aligned}
  \mathcal{B}^{AA, BB} &= \left[\mathcal{X} - \mathcal{H}'_{O} - \mathcal{A}\right]^{AA, BB} \\
  &= \left[\frac{1}{2}[(-\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{X})- \textrm{h.c.}] - \mathcal{A}\right]^{AA, BB} \\
  &= \left[\frac{1}{2}[(-\mathcal{U}'^\dagger [\mathcal{X} - \mathcal{H}'_{O} - \mathcal{A}])- \textrm{h.c.}] - \frac{1}{2}[\mathcal{A}^\dagger + \mathcal{A} ] + {\frac{1}{2}[( - \mathcal{U}'^\dagger\mathcal{A} ) - \textrm{h.c.}]}\right]^{AA, BB}, \\
  &= \left[\frac{1}{2}[(-\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{B})- \textrm{h.c.}] - \frac{1}{2}[\mathcal{A}^\dagger + \textrm{h.c.} ]\right]^{AA, BB},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where we used Eq.~\eqref{eq:Z} and that $\mathcal{U}'^\dagger \mathcal{A}$ is Hermitian.
%
Finally, we combine Eq.~\eqref{eq:H_tilde}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:UHU}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:B_diag} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:B_offdiag} to obtain the final expression for the effective Hamiltonian:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:H_tilde_optimized}
\tilde{\mathcal{H}}_D = \mathcal{H}_D + (\mathcal{A} + \textrm{h.c.})/2 -(\mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{B} + \textrm{h.c.})/2.
\end{equation}
