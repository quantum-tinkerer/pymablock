# Conclusion

**
In summary, we have developed an efficient algorithm to construct effective
Hamiltonians with several perturbations and of different types.
**

**Its implementation has already proven useful to study some problems in
condensed matter physics, but we think it can be applied to many more.**
Here I'd like to highlight the kind of problems that we have already solved
using Pymablock, and also say that there's a lot more that can be done.
Giving examples of the kinds of problems people still struggle with in the
context of superconducting circuits for example, but maybe this fits better in
the introduction.

**Pymablock is a versatile tool that can be further developed to tackle
time-dependent Hamiltonians, many-body Hamiltonians, continuum Hamiltonians,
multi-band Hamiltonians, symmetric Hamiltonians, non-orthogonal basis, and
more, but we leave this for future work.**
