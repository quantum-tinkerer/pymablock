# Introduction

**Effective models enable the study of complex physical systems by reducing the space of interest to a low energy one.**

**To find an effective Hamiltonian, we use perturbative approaches, like a SW transformation or Lowdin perturbation theory.**

**Even though these methods are standard, their algorithm is computationally expensive, scaling poorly for large systems and high orders.**

**We develop an efficient algorithm capable of symbolic and numeric computations and make it available in Pymablock.**

**Building an effective model with Pymablock is easy, its core is a versatile block diagonalization routine.**
