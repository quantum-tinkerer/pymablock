\section{Introduction}

\co{Effective models enable the study of complex physical systems by reducing the space of interest to a low-energy one.}
Effective models enable the study of complex quantum systems by reducing the dimensionality of the Hilbert space.
Their construction separates the low and high-energy subspaces by block-diagonalizing a perturbed Hamiltonian
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H} = \begin{pmatrix}H_0^{AA} & 0 \\ 0 & H_0^{BB}\end{pmatrix} + \mathcal{H}',
\end{equation}
%
where $H_0^{AA}$ and $H_0^{BB}$ are separated by an energy gap, and $\mathcal{H}'$ is a series in a perturbative parameter.
This procedure requires finding a series of the basis transformation $\mathcal{U}$ that is unitary and that also cancels the off-diagonal block of the transformed Hamiltonian order by order, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:block_diagonalization}.
The low-energy effective Hamiltonian $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}^{AA}$ is then a series in the perturbative parameter, whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors are approximate solutions of the complete Hamiltonian.
As a consequence, the effective model is sufficient to describe the low-energy properties of the original system while also being simpler and easier to handle.

\co{A standard approach to constructing the effective model is the Schrieffer-Wolff algorithm.}
A common approach to constructing an effective Hamiltonian is the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation~\cite{Schrieffer_1966,Bravyi_2011}, also known as LÃ¶wdin partitioning~\cite{Lowdin_1962}, or quasi-degenerate perturbation theory.
This method parameterizes the unitary transformation $\mathcal{U} = e^{-\mathcal{S}}$ and finds the series $\mathcal{S}$ that decouples the $A$ and $B$ subspaces of $\tilde{\mathcal{H}} = e^{\mathcal{S}}\mathcal{H}e^{-\mathcal{S}}$.
This idea enabled advances in multiple fields of quantum physics.
As an example, all the k.p models are a result of treating crystalline momentum as a perturbation that only weakly mixes atomic orbitals separated in energy~\cite{Luttinger_1955}.
More broadly, this method serves as a go-to tool in the study of superconducting circuits and quantum dots, where couplings between circuit elements and drives are treated as perturbations to reproduce the dynamics of the system~\cite{Krantz_2019,Romhanyi_2015}.

\co{Even though these methods are standard, their algorithm is computationally expensive, scaling poorly for large systems and high orders.}
Constructing effective Hamiltonians is, however, both algorithmically complex and computationally expensive.
This is a consequence of the recursive equations that define the unitary transformation, which require an exponentially growing number of matrix products in each order.
In particular, already a 4-th order perturbative expansion that is necessary for many applications may require hundreds of terms.
While the computational complexity is only a nuisance when analysing model systems, it becomes a bottleneck whenever the Hilbert space is high-dimensional.
Several alternative approaches improve the performance of the Schrieffer--Wolff algorithm by either using different parametrizations of the unitary transformation~\cite{Van_Vleck_1929, Shavitt_1980, Lowdin_1962, Klein_1974, Suzuki_1983}, adjusting the problem setting to density matrix perturbation theory~\cite{McWeeny_1962, Truflandier_2020}, or a finding a similarity transform instead of a unitary~\cite{Bloch_1958}.
A more recent line of research even applies the ideas of Schrieffer--Wolff transformation to quantum algorithms for the study of many-body systems~\cite{Wurtz_2020, Zhang_2022}.
Despite these advances, neither of the approaches combines an optimal scaling with the ability to construct effective Hamiltonians.

\co{We develop an efficient algorithm capable of symbolic and numeric computations and make it available in Pymablock.}
We introduce an algorithm to construct effective models with optimal scaling, thus making it possible to find high order effective models for systems with millions of degrees of freedom.
This algorithm exploits the efficiency of recursive evaluations of series satisfying polynomial constraints and obtains the same effective Hamiltonian as the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation.
We make the algorithm available via the open source package Pymablock \footnote{The documentation and tutorials are available in \url{https://pymablock.readthedocs.io/}}(PYthon MAtrix BLOCK-diagonalization), a versatile tool for the study of numerical and symbolic models.
