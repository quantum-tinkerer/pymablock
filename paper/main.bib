The minimum volume is approximately one cc, and the leakage is negligible. Its windows of rocksalt may easily be removed and repolished.}",

title = {The electronic properties of bilayer graphene},
journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {We review the electronic properties of bilayer graphene, beginning with a description of the tight-binding model of bilayer graphene and the derivation of the effective Hamiltonian describing massive chiral quasiparticles in two parabolic bands at low energies. We take into account five tight-binding parameters of the Slonczewski–Weiss–McClure model of bulk graphite plus intra- and interlayer asymmetry between atomic sites which induce band gaps in the low-energy spectrum. The Hartree model of screening and band-gap opening due to interlayer asymmetry in the presence of external gates is presented. The tight-binding model is used to describe optical and transport properties including the integer quantum Hall effect, and we also discuss orbital magnetism, phonons and the influence of strain on electronic properties. We conclude with an overview of electronic interaction effects.}

title = {Kwant: a software package for quantum transport},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport calculations. It aims to be a user-friendly, universal, and high-performance toolbox for the simulation of physical systems of any dimensionality and geometry that can be described by a tight-binding model. Kwant has been designed such that the natural concepts of the theory of quantum transport (lattices, symmetries, electrodes, orbital/spin/electron-hole degrees of freedom) are exposed in a simple and transparent way. Defining a new simulation setup is very similar to describing the corresponding mathematical model. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Greenʼs functions, and out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented easily thanks to its extensible and modular nature. Kwant is free software available at http://kwant-project.org/.}

Particular attention is focused on a ’’canonical’’ form of van Vleck perturbation theory, for which new and highly compact formulas are obtained. Detailed comparisons are made with the Kirtman–Certain–Hirschfelder form of the van Vleck approach and with the approach based on intermediate normalization which has been used as the basis for most of the diagrammatic formulations of quasidegenerate perturbation theory.}",

It is then reformulated in terms of an operator language in order to permit a discussion of the various methods of solving the Schrödinger equation. The total space is divided into two parts by means of a self‐adjoint projection operator O. Introducing the symbolic inverse T = (1—O)/(E—H), one can show that there exists an operator Ω = O + THO, which is an idempotent eigenoperator to H and satisfies the relations HΩ = EΩ and Ω2 = Ω. This operator is not normal but has a form which directly corresponds to infinite‐order perturbation theory. Both the Brillouin‐ and Schrödinger‐type formulas may be derived by power series expansion of T, even if other forms are perhaps more natural. The concept of the reaction operator is discussed, and upper and lower bounds for the true eigenvalues are finally derived.}",

abstract = { In this paper, we analyze the main features and discuss the tuning of the algorithms for the direct solution of sparse linear systems on distributed memory computers developed in the context of a long term European research project. The algorithms use a multifrontal approach and are especially designed to cover a large class of problems. The problems can be symmetric positive definite, general symmetric, or unsymmetric matrices, both possibly rank deficient, and they can be provided by the user in several formats. The algorithms achieve high performance by exploiting parallelism coming from the sparsity in the problem and that available for dense matrices. The algorithms use a dynamic distributed task scheduling technique to accommodate numerical pivoting and to allow the migration of computational tasks to lightly loaded processors. Large computational tasks are divided into subtasks to enhance parallelism. Asynchronous communication is used throughout the solution process to efficiently overlap communication with computation.We illustrate our design choices by experimental results obtained on an SGI Origin 2000 and an IBM SP2 for test matrices provided by industrial partners in the PARASOL project. }

abstract = {We consider the problem of designing a dynamic scheduling strategy that takes into account both workload and memory information in the context of the parallel multifrontal factorization. The originality of our approach is that we base our estimations (work and memory) on a static optimistic scenario during the analysis phase. This scenario is then used during the factorization phase to constrain the dynamic decisions that compute fully irregular partitions in order to better balance the workload. We show that our new scheduling algorithm significantly improves both the memory behaviour and the factorization time. We give experimental results for large challenging real-life 3D problems on 64 and 128 processors.}
